					<p>Our client came to us expressing concerns about the UI and UX of his product.

The main challenge was <span class="highlights">addressing and prioritizing doctor's different needs</span> to generate accurate results tailored to the user.

To set the scope, we decided to start with a <span class="highlights">heuristic evaluation to determine the most critical issues</span> of the website. Including my partner and I, there were a total of  4 evaluators. We then arranged the results from the most critical issue on the left to the least on the right. </p>

					<p>After the heuristic evaluation, my partner and I carried out some user interviews. We decided to focus on the physician side because a large physician user base will help covert hospital recruiters to using MedMatch, which drives MedMatch's revenue.
					<br>
					<br>
					The main objective of our interviews were to look for <span class="highlights">opportunities for improvement</span> with the existing application process, also explore any<span class="highlights"> pre-existing barriers</span> for users to adapting to an automated application process.

					<p>With our design principles and problem statement in mind, we came to the conclusion that using an <span class="highlights">onboarding process</span> that can afford users to input <span class="highlights">multiple needs and system to rank their importance</span> would help generate results that are more tailored to the needs of the users, as well as help the users <span class="highlights">trust the system</span> more because they understand where the results are coming from.
